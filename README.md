# liri-node-app

This app takes in the following four commands: 
1) concert-this
2) spotify-this-song
3) movie-this
4) do-what-it-says

Run the app through the console/bash with node, and include one of the 
four commands, along with appropriate parameters. 

For example, the concert-this command lists upcoming concert info for 
the band/artist of your choosing. To see information for the artist Imagine Dragons,
the input would be "node liri.js concert-this Imagine Dragons"

The command spotify-this-song returns information regarding the song name
you input. For example, "node liri.js spotify-this-song Radioactive"

The command movie-this provides information for a movie of your choice. 
For example, "node liri.js movie-this nacho libre"

Finally, do-what-it-says runs a command from the random.txt file. In its 
current form, the app will run "spotify-this-song" for the song "I Want it That Way".
